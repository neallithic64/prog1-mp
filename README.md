# CCPROG1 Machine Project: Circles & Hypotrochoids
This project written in C was submitted as partial requirement for my CCPROG1 class. It's divided into three parts:
1. Create `sine()` and `cosine()` implementations without using the math.h header file.
2. Generate coordinates for a circle shape using `sine()` and `cosine()` from Part 1 (this part was more focused on compiling and linking with `gcc.exe`).
3. Generate coordinates for hypotrochoid shapes using `sine()` and `cosine()` from Part 1.

To run, the following files are used:
1. For Part 1, `mp1.c` is used.
2. For Part 2, `LINGUA_main.c` is used.
3. For Part 3, `LINGUA_spirograph.c` is used.
