# CCPROG1 Machine Project: Circles & Hypotrochoids
This project written in C was submitted as partial requirement for my CCPROG1 class. It's divided into three parts:
1. Create sine() and cosine() implementations without using the math.h header file.
2. Generate coordinates for a circle shape using sine() and cosine() from Part 1 (this part was more focused on compiling and linking with gcc.exe).
3. Generate coordinates for hypotrochoid shapes using sine() and cosine() from Part 1.
